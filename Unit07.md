**Unit 7: Special Relativity** <span id="7"></span> 
*The physical descriptions we have studied to this point were based on a
notion of absolute space and time.  A model for this point of view was
that space is filled everywhere by a continuous medium called the
ether.  Light and other forms of electromagnetic radiation were waves in
this ether, analogous to sound waves in air.  All other phenomena were
to be understood as various manifestations of Maxwell’s
electromagnetism, which was originally based on a mechanical model of
ether.  It seemed reasonable that the 19<sup>th</sup> Century ‘theory of
everything’ could be tied down by measuring the ‘elastic’ properties of
the ether.  
  
 Toward the end of the 1800s, however, this model became associated with
more and more hastily patched cracks.  The detailed history of the
gradual realization that ether models were not quite right is complex
and technical.  However, there is one rather clear indication of
trouble.  In 1887, Albert Michelson and Edmund Morley of the Case
Institute (now Case Western University) performed an experiment using an
optical interferometer in which they compared the speed of light in two
beams traveling at right angles to each other.  If the speed of light
relative to the ether was always the same, the measured speed of light
would be larger or smaller depending on the direction the experiment was
traveling through the ether.  The motion of the Michelson-Morley
experiment was provided by the rotation of the Earth on its axis and the
orbital motion of the Earth around the Sun, as well as the absolute
velocity (if any) of the Sun relative to the ether.  
  
 They expected to see both diurnal changes and yearly changes in the
relative velocities of light in the two paths.  True, the changes
expected by classical ether theory were small (on the order of 0.01% of
the velocity of light), but the Michelson-Morley interferometer was able
to detect velocity changes about 6-7 times smaller.  To the surprise of
all, there were no changes whatever observed.  This experiment was
widely repeated, using constantly improving equipment – a new version of
the experiment carried out in 2002 established that the velocity of
light is constant to better than 1 part in 10<sup>15</sup> – one of the
most precise physical measurements ever accomplished.  
  
 The explanation of the Michelson-Morley null result was length
contraction, as developed by Hendrik Lorentz and George Francis
FitzGerald.  Length contraction explained the Michelson-Morley result,
the idea being that matter is held together by electromagnetic forces
(true), and so the actual size of objects will change with motion
through the ether (false).  In the end, it was Albert Einstein’s
formulation of the theory of Special Relativity that gave us a
consistent explanation of all such phenomena.  His primary postulate was
to accept that the speed of light and the laws of physics are constant
in all reference frames – including reference frames which are in
motion.  Oddly, despite the fact that Einstein’s theory completely
explained the Michelson-Morley result, he took no motivation for his
theory from that experiment.*

    special relativity that we will cover in this unit.  Read the text
    carefully, but please do not think that you have to memorize every
    single fact.  What you should strive for is to be sure that it makes
    sense to you as you are reading it and that when you are finished
    you can briefly summarize the main points of the reading.  You
    should read this both as you start and after you have finished
    working your way through the unit.

    lectures, pausing to take notes, before moving on to Professor
    Shankar’s lecture below.  The first video lecture deals with the
    relativity of time, and the second video lecture discusses the
    equation E = mc<sup>2</sup>.  The second video ends abruptly but not
    before the important point has been made.  What the accelerator
    example goes on to show is the conversion of kinetic energy into
    mass energy through the production of particle-antiparticle pairs.  
      
     You should spend approximately 30 minutes on these lectures.

     Instructions: Please click on the link above.  This applet
    demonstrates the expectation of Michelson and Morley that if the
    speed of light was constant through the ether (the speed of the
    swimmers is constant through the water) and the detection device is
    moving through the ether (the platform is moving through the water),
    then the travel time for the perpendicular light beams (the travel
    time for the two swimmers) would be different – common sense, right.
     Can you explain why the special theory addresses the fact that the
    travel times in the Michelson-Morley were actually the same?  
      
     You should spend about 15 minutes exploring the applet.
