**Unit 4: Electronic Circuit Theory** <span id="4"></span> 
*Although the study of electric and magnetic fields is interesting in
and of itself, it may not seem directly useful in the real world. 
However, the interplay between these phenomena is responsible for much
of the technology you see in your everyday life.  For example, all
electronics apply various features of electromagnetism, so that
computers, HDTV, iMacs and iPads, smartphones, motors, fans, lights, and
so on are applied electromagnetic devices.  In this unit, we will take a
quick look at the foundations of electronics, while at the same time
adding to our understanding of electromagnetism.*

    separation of the plates and the dielectric constant of the material
    between them.  In this demonstration, you will control the geometry
    and materials of the capacitor, and you will measure the charge
    resident on the capacitor as a function of applied voltage.  Use the
    theoretical description here and in the lectures and readings above
    to confirm that the workings of the demonstration agree with
    physical reality.

     Instructions: To use this demonstration, you must download and
    install the [Mathematica
    Viewer](http://www.wolfram.com/products/player) from the Wolfram
    Demonstrations Project.  A partially-filled capacitor can be viewed
    as a pair of capacitors, one filled and the other unfilled.  (Note
    that this is only true for geometries where the dielectric interface
    is approximately on an equipotential surface, as nothing then
    changes when the extra pair of metal plates is inserted.  This same
    technique could be used on a partially-filled cylindrical or
    spherical capacitor, for example, provided the dielectric surface
    was cylindrical or spherical, respectively.)  Treat this as a
    laboratory experiment, and confirm that the demonstration is
    accurate.

    which you measure the capacitance of various geometries and use
    theory to confirm that the capacitances are correct.  Then,
