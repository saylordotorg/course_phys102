**Unit 6: Optics** <span id="6"></span> 
*An optical phenomenon involves the interaction between electromagnetic
waves and matter.  We will focus on visible, infrared, and ultraviolet
light, but much of the study of optics will apply to some extent to
radio waves and x-rays.  The complete study of optics involves
enormously complex mathematics, a thorough understanding of both
classical and quantum optical effects, and a great deal of ingenuity for
success.  
  
 For the purposes of this course, optics will be limited to the
classical description of electromagnetism provided by Maxwell’s
equations: the full wave optics.  Even this level of description is
quite complicated for most optical phenomena, so we will apply
simplified models to develop a basic understanding of how optics works. 
In geometric optics, we assume that all light travels in straight
lines.  In paraxial optics, we assume that all optical systems handle
light rays near a symmetry axis of the optical system, which allows us
to largely ignore aberration, a vast array of terribly complex optical
effects.  In theory, the full wave optics provides the most complete
picture of optics possible with a classical description, but the most
fascinating optical effects are (arguably) intrinsically quantum
mechanical in nature.  (Patience is a virtue.)*

    well-illustrated in this demonstration.  Note that the key is not
    the amount of incident light reflected, but rather the extent to
    which information about the original direction of the light is lost
    in the reflection.  The demonstration may run slowly on older

     Instructions: To use this demonstration, you must download and
    install the [Mathematica
    Viewer](http://www.wolfram.com/products/player) from the Wolfram
    Demonstrations Project.  When a light ray is within a medium having
    a refractive index n<sub>1</sub> and is incident on an interface
    between that medium and a second medium having a smaller refractive
    index n<sub>2</sub>, Snell’s Law tells you that the angle at which
    the light is refracted in the second medium is given by sin
    θ<sub>2</sub> = (n<sub>1</sub>/n<sub>2</sub>) sin θ<sub>1</sub>.  
      
     What happens if (n<sub>1</sub>/n<sub>2</sub>) sin θ<sub>1</sub> is
    greater than 1?  Because sin θ<sub>2</sub> cannot be greater than 1,
    the light ray cannot be refracted into the second medium.  As a
    result, the ray is reflected from the interface.  The reflection is
    total (neglecting possible processes of absorption which might occur
    right at the interface, such as dye molecules or the like), because
    there is no mechanism whereby any of the light can penetrate into
    the second medium.  (This is actually only the case for infinitely
    thick media, as light can penetrate a distance related to the skin
    depth.  However, for most practical purposes the reflection is
    complete.)  
      
     Total internal reflection is unlike reflection from a metallized
    mirror, in which the metal absorbs some of the light incident on the
    surface.  This difference explains why the reflecting face of a
    prism is usually left unmetallized whenever that is consistent with
    its optical function; more light passes through the optical system
    than does when a mirror is used.

     Instructions: To use this demonstration, you must download and
    install the [Mathematica
    Viewer](http://www.wolfram.com/products/player) from the Wolfram
    Demonstrations Project.  This demonstration illustrates the
    phenomenon of spherical aberration.  As the center of a sphere lays
    on the perpendicular ray through every point on the mirror surface,
    a spherical mirror produces a perfect focus of a point light source
    located at its radius of curvature.  However, this is not the case
    as such a mirror is used to form an image of a point source placed a
    long distance away.  
      
     As the light moves away from the mirror, the focal point of the
    mirror moves toward the mirror.  The point of light and the focal
    point define an ellipsoid which is the ideal mirror shape to give a
    perfect focus.  As you may remember from high school geometry, when
    one of the foci of an ellipsoid is moved infinitely far away, the
    shape becomes a paraboloid.  This is why a parabolic mirror gives a
    perfect focus of a distant source of light.  
      
     In the demonstration, you can experiment with the control
    parameters to evaluate how imperfect the focus of a spherical mirror
    is for a distant source.  You will discover that the imperfection,
    called spherical aberration, is a major influence when the ratio of
    the mirror focal length to its diameter (called the f/ratio) is
    small.
