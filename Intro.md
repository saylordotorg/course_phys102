Course Syllabus for "PHYS102: Introduction to Electromagnetism"
---------------------------------------------------------------

The physics of the universe appears to be dominated by the effects of
four fundamental forces: gravity, electromagnetism, weak nuclear forces,
and strong nuclear forces.  These forces control how matter, energy,
space, and time interact to produce our physical world.  All other
forces, such as the force you exert in standing up, are ultimately
derived from these fundamental forces. We have direct daily experience
with two of these forces: gravity and electromagnetism.  Consider, for
example, the everyday sight of a person sitting on a chair.  The force
holding the person on the chair is gravitational, and that gravitational
force balances with material forces that “push up” to keep the
individual in place.  These forces are the direct result of
electromagnetic forces on the nanoscale.  On a larger stage, gravity
holds the celestial bodies in their orbits, while we see the universe by
the electromagnetic radiation (light, for example) with which it is
filled.  The electromagnetic force also makes possible the advanced
technology that forms much of the basis for our civilization. 
Televisions, computers, smartphones, microwave ovens, and even the
humble light bulb are made possible by control of electromagnetism.  The
average physics major will spend more time understanding and applying
the concept of electromagnetic force than he or she will spend studying
any other type of force. The classical (i.e., non-quantum) theory of
electromagnetism was first published by James Clerk Maxwell in his 1873
textbook *A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism. * A host of
scientists during the nineteenth century carried out the work that
ultimately led to Maxwell’s electromagnetism equations, which is still
considered one of the triumphs of classical physics.  Maxwell’s
description of electromagnetism, which demonstrates that electricity and
magnetism are different aspects of a unified electromagnetic field,
holds true today.  In fact, Maxwell’s equations are consistent with
relativity, which was not theorized until 30 years after Maxwell
completed his equations. In this course, we will first learn about waves
and oscillations in extended objects using the classical mechanics that
we learned about in [Physics
101](http://www.saylor.org/courses/phys101/).  We will also establish
the sources and laws that govern static electricity and magnetism.  A
brief look at electrical measurements and circuits will help us
understand how electromagnetic effects are observed, measured, and
applied.  We will then see how Maxwell’s equations unify electric and
magnetic effects and how the solutions to Maxwell’s equations describe
electromagnetic radiation, which will serve as the basis for
understanding all electromagnetic radiation, from very low frequency,
long wavelength radio waves to the most powerful astrophysical gamma
rays.  We will briefly study optics, using practical models largely
consistent with the predictions of Maxwell’s equations but that are
easier to use.  Finally, this course provides a brief overview of
Einstein’s theory of special relativity.  We will assume that you have a
basic knowledge of calculus
([MA101](http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma101/)), and you will need to
know the principles covered in
[MA102](http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma102/) (a co-requisite for this
course) as well. This course will require you to complete a number of
problems.  Unlike mechanics, most of the phenomena encountered in the
field of electromagnetism are not found in everyday experience – at
least, not in a form that makes the actual nature of the phenomena
clear.  As a result, learning electromagnetism involves developing
intuition about a rather unintuitive area of physics.  In the end,
developing physical intuition is less about getting a right answer than
it is about getting a wrong answer and then understanding why it is
wrong.  In an ideal situation, this course would require you to both
work out problems concerning the phenomena and observe various important
phenomena in the laboratory.  However, because this is an online course,
we do not have the luxury of lab sessions.  We have included a number of
interactive demonstrations to compensate for this.  When you approach a
problem, try to work out the size of those quantities that clarify the
basic nature of the question proposed.  Thinking of these numbers as
data from an ideal laboratory will help you develop a sense of how
electromagnetism works – a sense that most people do not get from the
mathematical description of the physics.

### Course Information

Welcome to PHYS102.  Below, please find general information on this
course and its requirements.  
  
 **Primary Resources:** This course is comprised of a range of different
free, online materials.  However, the course makes primary use of the
following resources:

-   Fullerton College: Professor Benjamin Crowell’s *[Light and
    Matter](http://www.lightandmatter.com/lm/)*
-   University of Texas: Professor Richard Fitzpatrick’s
    *[Electromagnetism and
    Optics](http://farside.ph.utexas.edu/teaching/316/lectures/lectures.html)*

In addition, there will be interactive laboratory demonstrations
provided by the Wolfram Demonstrations Project.  
  
 The mathematics required for this course is somewhat more advanced than
for Physics 101.  This will be particularly true for Unit 5 on Maxwell’s
equations.  To prepare you for this level of mathematics, several
resources are provided throughout the course.  
  
 **Requirements for Completion:** In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its readings and
lectures.  You will also need to complete the Final Exam.  
  
 Note that you will only receive an official grade on your Final Exam. 
However, in order to adequately prepare for this exam, you will need to
work through the problems assigned throughout the course.  
  
 In order to “pass” this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher
on the Final Exam.  Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as
you complete it.  If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.  
  
 **Time Commitment:** This course should take a total of **142.25**
**hours** to complete.  Each unit includes a “time advisory” that lists
the amount of time you are expected to spend on it and each of its
subunits.  These should help you plan your time accordingly.  It may be
useful to take a look at these time advisories and to determine how much
time you have over the next few weeks to complete each unit, and then to
set goals for yourself.  For example, Unit 1 should take 9.25 hours to
complete.  Perhaps you can sit down with your calendar and decide to
complete subunit 1.1 (a total of 3.5 hours) on Monday night; subunit 1.2
(a total of 2.25 hours) on Tuesday night; subunit 1.3 (a total of 3.5
hours) on Wednesday night; etc.  Note that the course begins with a Math
Review.  This review should be completed as you work through Units 1-5
of the course; you may refer back to the resources in this review as a
reference as you study subsequent units.  
  
 **Tips/Suggestions:** Your studyof electromagnetism will require a
level of mathematics beyond that required for your previous physics
courses.  It is very important that you study the pertinent math before
trying to work on the problems.  Otherwise, you will find the problems
very frustrating.  The primary mathematical resource is a reading by
Professor Michael Corral on vector calculus, from which 98 problems are
assigned.  For maximum benefit, you should work on these gradually
throughout the course, making sure that you are almost through by the
time you get to Unit 5 on Maxwell’s equations.  Good luck to you in this
undertaking you are about to embark on.
