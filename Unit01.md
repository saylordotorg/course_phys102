**Unit 1: Mechanical Vibrations and Waves in Extended Objects** <span
id="1"></span> 
*In PHYS101, we learned how to describe the motion of particle-like
masses using classical mechanics.  We will start PHYS102 by examining
how objects of size – length, width, depth – behave.  We will focus on
vibrating systems and the propagation of mechanical waves through media;
think of ripples traveling outward from a stone dropped into water.
 This course will also lay the basic foundation for the development of a
classical theory of mechanics for extended solids.*

     Instructions: To use this demonstration, you must download and
    install the [Mathematica
    Viewer](http://www.wolfram.com/products/player) from the Wolfram
    Demonstrations Project.  This demonstration illustrates a very
    simple example of a non-harmonic oscillator – a helium balloon on a
    string.  There are two sources of non-linearity.  First, as the
    balloon rises, it lifts more string.  Therefore, the mass of the
    oscillator is a function of the position of the oscillating mass,
    which leads to non-linear behavior.  In addition, a damping term has
    been included which mimics the effect of air resistance.  Adjust the
    various control parameters to gain a feel for which parameters have
    a larger effect of the motion of the oscillator.

     Instructions: To use this demonstration, you must download and
    install the [Mathematica
    Viewer](http://www.wolfram.com/products/player) from the Wolfram
    Demonstrations Project.  The demonstration illustrates the motion of
    a mass on a spring.  When the mass is pulled down, the spring exerts
    a restoring force described by Hooke’s Law that pulls the mass
    upwards.  The result is that the mass travels up and down in simple
    harmonic motion, where the displacement of the mass is described by
    a sinusoidal curve.  Think of this demonstration as an experiment to
    verify (or not) the effect of Hooke’s Law on the period of
    oscillation.

    Demonstrations Project.  The Bell wave machine is a multi-rotor
    torsional oscillator that shows wave motion propagating down the
    central torsion wire.  Use your knowledge of the simple torsion
    pendulum to understand where the phase shift between neighboring
    rotors comes from, and why the overall effect is that of a

     Instructions: To use this demonstration, you must download and

    Demonstrations Project.  Waves are partially reflected by local
    changes in the medium through which they propagate.  This is
    illustrated here by the introduction of a point mass on a vibrating
    string.  The transmitted wave becomes smaller in amplitude as the
    mass becomes larger.  Why?  Is there a phase shift associated with
    reflection/transmission?  Why?
