**Unit 3: Magnetism** <span id="3"></span> 
*In Unit 2, we studied electric charges, potentials, and fields.  We
will now take a look at an important effect of moving charges:
magnetism.  Thales of Miletus set the stage for the scientific
exploration of magnetism back in Ancient Greek times, when magnetism
could only be observed via the behavior of natural magnets, called
lodestones.  Hans Christian Oersted first noted the relationship between
moving electric charges and magnetism much later, when he accidentally
discovered that an electric current could deflect a nearby compass
needle in 1820.  Forty-five years after Oersted made this observation,
James Clerk Maxwell united electrical and magnetic phenomena into four
reasonably simple equations known since as Maxwell’s Equations.*

    Demonstrations Project.  This demonstration is designed to remind
    you of one of the most common elementary school demonstrations of
    magnetism, where fine iron filings decorate the lines of magnetic
    force, showing, as in the demonstration, the dipole-like magnetic
    field of a permanent magnet.  If we place a ferromagnetic material,
    such as iron, in a magnetic field, it will induce a magnetic field
    in the iron that opposes the external field.  As usual, one of
    Nature’s rules is to arrange matters so that the total energy of the
    system is as small as possible.  In this case, inducing an opposing
    field in the iron reduces the total magnetic energy.  Because iron
    filings tend to be long and skinny, the induced field turns them
    into tiny bar magnets, with north and south poles aligned such that
    the north pole of the iron filing points along the local direction
    of the magnetic field and orients away from the north pole of the
    external magnet.  Accordingly, when you place a few hundred iron
    filings on a surface over a magnet, you are able to visualize the
    magnetic lines of force.

    “Dipole Fields Are Complicated.”  More accurately, the motion of
    electric charges in a magnetic dipole field is complicated.  Follow
    the suggestions for changing parameters listed within the
    demonstration.  Notice that very small changes in the system
    parameters sometimes result in large changes in the resulting
    trajectories.  (For example, by typing in the dynamic controls, set
    the magnetic field strength at 0.2, time of solution at 5000,
    X<sub>0</sub> at 1.5, Y<sub>0</sub> at 0.0, z<sub>0</sub> at 0.4,
    V<sub>x0</sub> at V<sub>y0</sub> at 0.0, and plot quality at 50. 
    You will now find very different trajectories for V<sub>z0</sub> =
    0.0186 and 0.0187.)  Extreme sensitivity to initial conditions is
    the most characteristic property of chaotic motion.  Try to find
    other parameters that suggest chaotic motion while keeping an eye on
    how trajectories change with the parameters.

    result is that the charge spirals toward a position, comes to a stop
    save for circular motion, and then reflects back in roughly the
    original direction.  Why?

    relationship is particularly easy to observe when constant magnetic
    fields parallel to the field lines can be seen.  Here, a constant
    flux is simply a constant number of field lines penetrating the wire

     Instructions: To use this demonstration, you must download and
    install the [Mathematica
    Viewer](http://www.wolfram.com/products/player) from the Wolfram
    Demonstrations Project.  Many machines use magnetic brakes  from the
    small to the gigantic.  The analysis of the effect is simple in some
    ways and quite tricky in others.  There are two ways of looking at
    magnetic braking, both of which are mentioned in the demonstration
    write-up.  The basic idea is that when a conductor moves through a
    magnetic field, currents are induced that resist the motion.  These
    are called Eddy currents, and the reduction in the kinetic energy of
    the conductor is equal to the resistive heating caused in the
    conductor by the induced Eddy currents.  Another approach to
    explaining magnetic braking is that the Lorentz force acting on the
    electrons in the moving conductor acts to move the electrons
    outward, and the Lorentz force associated with that outward motion
    in the applied magnetic field serves to slow down the moving
    conductor.  These two ways of thinking about magnetic braking are
    equivalent; that is, they make the same predictions.  A couple of
    questions for reflection: If the conductor is a perfect conductor
    (no resistance, but not a superconductor), is there any braking
    effect?  Also, can a magnetic brake by itself bring a moving
    conductor to a complete stop?  Why, or why not?

    classic classroom demonstration.  A conducting ring is placed atop
    an electromagnet, and a large pulse of current passes through the
    electromagnet.  As seen in the lectures, readings, and
    demonstrations above, a current is induced in the conducting ring in
    a direction which opposes the formation of the magnetic field.  As
    usual, this is to minimize the total energy of the system.  The
    result is that the current in the ring generates a magnetic field
    with the opposite sign as that of the electromagnet.  Opposed
    magnetic fields repel, so the ring launches into the air.  Why does
    nothing happen when we use the split ring?
