**Unit 2: Electrostatics** <span id="2"></span> 
*We are now beginning our study of electricity and magnetism.  We will
discover that electricity and magnetism are two different aspects of the
same phenomenon, which is usually referred to as electromagnetism.  Our
starting place will be electrostatics or, more simply, the rules
governing the behavior of static charges.  The first experiments on
electrical phenomena were carried out by our friend from PHYS101, Thales
of Miletus.  He observed that one could generate a static charge on
amber by rubbing it with wool.*

     Instructions: To use this demonstration, you must download and
    install the [Mathematica
    Viewer](http://www.wolfram.com/products/player) from the Wolfram
    Demonstrations Project.  The electroscope (also called a gold-leaf
    electroscope) was invented in the late eighteenth century to measure
    the size of small static charges.  A charge is transferred to a pair
    of neighboring gold leafs.  Acquiring charges of the same sign, the
    gold leafs repel each other, taking on an angle which depends on the
    mass of the gold leafs and the size of the charge.

     Instructions: To use this demonstration, you must download and
    install the [Mathematica
    Viewer](http://www.wolfram.com/products/player) from the Wolfram
    Demonstrations Project.  This demonstration illustrates how a Van de
    Graaff generator generates static charges and collects the charges
    on a metal sphere.  The voltage on the sphere is proportional to the
    amount of charge collected.  Though it appears that the collected
    charge on the sphere would increase indefinitely, in reality, paths
    for loss of the collected charge exist and typically limit the
    static voltage on the sphere to a fraction of a megavolt, although
    Van de Graaff generators specialized for use in nuclear accelerators
    can generate 10 megavolts or more.

     Instructions: To use this demonstration, you must download and
    install the [Mathematica
    Viewer](http://www.wolfram.com/products/player) from the Wolfram
    Demonstrations Project.  This demonstration illustrates what you
    would find in a lab experiment where two electrically charges bodies
    are placed on a table, and you measure the electric potential
    (roughly speaking, the voltage relative to a reference point) as a
    function of position on the table.  The electric potential is
    displayed as a series of equipotential curves, or curves along which
    the electric potential is constant.  Vary the position and strength
    of the charges, and then view the results with both the 3D and the
    contour plot.  Turn on the field direction, and notice that the
    electric field is everywhere perpendicular to the equipotential
    curves.  This is because the electric field is proportional to the
    gradient of the electric potential.

     Instructions: To use this demonstration, you must download and
    install the [Mathematica
    Viewer](http://www.wolfram.com/products/player) from the Wolfram
    Demonstrations Project.  This demonstration is an extension of the
    previous demonstration on Electric Dipole Potential.  Shown here
    again is an electrostatic dipole where the strengths of the electric
    charges can be varied.  The graph shows the lines of electric
    field.  The lines of electric field are everywhere perpendicular to
    the equipotential curves.  Note that this does not mean that the
    MAGNITUDE of the electric field is constant along an electric field
    line; it only means that the magnitude of the electric field points
    along that line.  Vary the positions and magnitude of the two
    charges to gain some feel for how the electric field behaves.  The
    calculations required by the demonstration are complex, so wait
    between changes for the graph to once again become smooth.

    Images”**
    Link: Wolfram Demonstrations Project: [“Method of
    Images”](http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/MethodOfImagesInElectrostatics/MethodOfImagesInElectrostatics.nbp)
    (Wolfram NBP)  
      
     Instructions: To use this demonstration, you must download and
    install the [Mathematica
    Viewer](http://www.wolfram.com/products/player) from the Wolfram
    Demonstrations Project.  This demonstration is valuable for gaining
    an understanding of the method of images, which is one of the more
    powerful elementary methods for calculating the electric potential
    and field resulting from a combination of charges and conductors. 
    In this case, the conductors take the form of a plane or a sphere. 
    The point is that a perfect conductor is always an equipotential
    surface and that metals are close enough to being perfect conductors
    for many purposes.  
      
     The basis for the method of images is that the electric potential
    of a charge near a metal surface will be the same as that of a
    system of charges that produces the same equipotential surface as
    would the metal surface.  In the case of a first charge near a plane
    conductor, we form the simplest system of charges that produces a
    planar equipotential surface at the position of the conducting
    surface by placing a second charge behind the conducting surface. 
    The second charge is located behind the conducting surface on a line
    through the first charge positioned normal to the conducting
    surface.  The second charge is placed as far behind the surface as
    the first charge is in front of the surface.  Then, the electric
    potential of this pair of point charges has the same electric field
    as the charge near the metal surface but is much simpler to solve
    for.  
      
     The logic behind the method of images applies when a charge is near
    a spherical conducting surface, save that the equipotential surface
    forced by addition of the second charge must reproduce the shape of
    the spherical conductor.  Note that although the demonstration
    states that the conductors must be grounded, this is not true; the
    method of images still works with ungrounded conductors.  The only
    difference is that the potentials are uniformly larger or smaller
    depending on just the electric potential on the conducting
    surface.  
      
     You should spend approximately 15 minutes on completing this lab.
