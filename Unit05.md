**Unit 5: Maxwell’s Equations** <span id="5"></span> 
*At this point in the course, we have developed the mathematical
structure for and a general understanding of all of Maxwell’s
Equations.  Now we want to sit back and summarize our findings by
identifying what they are, what they mean, and how we can use them.*  
  
 *There are four Maxwell equations that describe all classical
electromagnetism.  Maxwell’s equations take on a particularly simple
form when describing the behavior of electric and magnetic fields in
regions devoid of matter; that is, in a vacuum.  (Note that for most
purposes, air is close enough to being a vacuum that the presence of an
atmosphere can be ignored.)  These are Maxwell’s free space
equations.*  
  
 *There are four Maxwell free space equations.  These include the two
flux equations – the electric and magnetic forms of Gauss’ law.  These
state that the electric or magnetic flux through a closed surface is
proportional to the electric or magnetic charge enclosed within that
surface.  Note that in the magnetic case, there are no magnetic charges
(also called magnetic monopoles), so that the magnetic flux through and
closed surface is zero.*  
  
 *The other two free space Maxwell’s equations are Faraday’s Law of
Induction and a modified version of Ampere’s Circuital Law.  Once again,
these electric and magnetic equations have similar formalisms, thereby
emphasizing the close relationship of the electric and magnetic fields. 
Faraday’s Law of Induction states that the induced EMF in any closed
circuit is proportional to the time rate of change of the magnetic flux
through the circuit, while Ampere’s Law states that the integrated
magnetic field around a closed curve is proportional to the currents
passing through a surface bounded by the curve.  Maxwell’s main
contribution (beyond realizing that these four equations provided a
complete theory of electromagnetism) was the discovery and description
of the displacement current, which is a source of the magnetic field
associated with the rate of change of the electric displacement field in
a region.*  
  
 *Inside materials, Maxwell’s Equations are modified by the electric
permittivity and magnetic permeability of the materials, but they remain
the basis for the classical model of electromagnetism.  In this unit, we
will concentrate on Maxwell’s Equations as a single theory that unites
the half century of previous work on electromagnetism. *

     Instructions: Please click on the link above, and then click on
    part 1 to download the PDF.  Most of this chapter reviews Maxwell’s
    time-independent equations but often from a different viewpoint that
    acts synergistically with our previously covered material.  Take
    particular note of the definition on page 7 of the electric flux
    density vector **D** = ε **E**, where **E** is the electric field
    vector and ε is the dielectric constant times the free space
    permittivity ε<sub>o</sub>.  Similarly, on page 12 the magnetic flux
    density vector **B** = μ **H**, where **H** is the magnetic field
    vector and μ is the magnetic permeability, sometimes described as
    the relative permeability times the permeability of free space.  For
    this class, these equations that allow the use of Maxwell’s
    Equations in a material are assumed to be scalar functions of
    position.  The general case is that they are tensors, but the scalar
    approximation simplifies gaining an initial understanding of the
    behavior of electromagnetism systems.  Work through the examples
    until you understand how to approach solving similar problems.

    Viewer](http://www.wolfram.com/products/player) from the Wolfram
    Demonstrations Project.  This is an illustrative explanation of
    displacement current, which is arguably the linchpin of Maxwell’s
    full theory of electromagnetism, as well as the single most
    confusing concept in that theory.  
      
     There is no electric current between the plates of a capacitor. 
    However, Ampere’s Circuital Law tells us that the integral of the
    magnetic field B around a closed loop C is proportional to the flux
    of the current density through a surface S attached to the loop. 
    This is independent of the shape of S.  In the demonstration,
    consider a closed loop positioned around one of the wires carrying
    electric current into the charging capacitor.  If S is chosen so
    that the wire penetrates the surface, the flux of the current
    density through S is simply the electric current.  
      
     Now draw another surface S’ so that it passes between the capacitor
    plates, thereby making no contact with the current carrying wire. 
    There is no electric current between the capacitor plates, so it
    would appear that the flux of the current density through S’ is
    zero.  However, Ampere’s Circuital Law tells us that the magnetic
    field integral around loop C is still the same non-zero value.  We
    appear to meet a contradiction.  
      
     What the apparent contradiction is actually telling us is that
    Ampere’s Circuital Law is incomplete.  The electric field between
    the plates of a charging capacitor changes  with time, so it would
    appear that a time-varying electric field must generate a magnetic
    field which is consistent with the current charging the capacitor. 
    The way Maxwell chose to think about this by identifying a
    fictitious current between the capacitor plates called the
    displacement current such that the total displacement current flux
    between the plates was equal to the current charging the capacitor. 
    Although there is no actual electrical current between the plates,
    we still refer to the source of magnetic field associated with a
    changing electric field as the displacement current.

     Instructions: To use this demonstration, you must download and

    Viewer](http://www.wolfram.com/products/player) from the Wolfram
    Demonstrations Project.  This demonstration schematically indicates
    the time-dependent electric and magnetic fields associated with an
    electromagnetic wave.  Note that the electric and magnetic fields
    are mutually perpendicular to one another and to the path the wave
    follows.  
      
     As the electric field changes in time, a magnetic field is
    generated as described by Maxwell’s generalization of Ampere’s
    Circuital Law.  As the magnetic field changes in time, an electric
    field is produced as described by Faraday’s Law of Induction.  Given
    this word picture, why are the electric field strength and the
    maximum magnetic field strength proportional at all times?  Which
    direction does the wave velocity point, toward positive or negative
    x?  (Hint: Look at Poynting’s Theorem.)

    Rømer had been able to establish that the speed of light was not
    infinite.  For example, in the early seventeenth century, Galileo
    attempted to measure the speed of light by relaying signals between
    a pair of lanterns, but he could only establish that light traveled
    faster than a few kilometers per second.  Throughout the period
    1668-1674, Rømer made and recorded accurate measurements of the
    eclipses of the moons of Jupiter.  He found that the times would
    vary by about 16.5 minutes during the course of a year, and he
    explained this as the time it takes light to traverse the diameter
    of Earth’s orbit around the Sun.  Using an inaccurate value for the
    size of Earth’s orbit, he obtained a value of about 214,000 km/sec
    for the speed of light – about 20% smaller than the actual value.

    point in our course, the integral formulation of Maxwell’s Equations
    has been presented.  However, Maxwell’s Equations are more often
    used in a different, although completely consistent, version – one
    expressed in terms of partial differential equations.  As this
    formulation requires junior-level math, we are not going to attempt
    to solve any problems.  However, it is worth reading this chapter to
    see that there is a totally different approach to describing
    electromagnetism.  The 2<sup>nd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> chapters of
    Corral’s *Vector Calculus* can help you try to make sense of Unit
    5.3.  There is a deep connection between the integral and
    differential versions of Maxwell’s equations, but demonstrating that
    relationship is beyond the scope of this course.
